# Java-Libs

This is a repository for all of the Java files that carry over year-to-year for FRC Team 5587, Titan Robotics. All of these files are free for use for another team or personal projects, so long as use complies with the license in this repository.

## Generating Documentation

To generate documentation, simply use the `javadoc` command on your desired file:
```bash
javadoc -d ./docs/ <path_to_file>
```

Afterwards, open the `index.html` file found in the `docs/` folder however you wish.
